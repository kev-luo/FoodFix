# Food Fix

Eating healthy and knowing how to cook healthy dishes can be difficult, even boring. We solved that problem and show you that being more health conscious can be simple and delicious.

Rather than wasting time scrolling through Google to find the perfect recipe, our app will present you with dishes that come with their recipe instructions, ingredient list, and nutrituon guide. In addition, our app allows you to choose a diet type, whether you're vegan, gluten-free, vegetarian, etc.; we have something for you! We make it easy for you to find whatever cravings you desire. It's really a one stop shop for anyone interested in cooking healthier meals.
