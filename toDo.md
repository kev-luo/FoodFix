**To Do**
**store searched recipes in local storage so that the user can return to the searched for recipes and choose a different one if they want**
**do we create a separate javascript file for each html page?**
**maybe use bulma progress bars instead of chart.js to display nutrition information**
**if we stick with chart.js learn how to add multiple y axes for cleaner display of nutrition**
**recipe instructions in list form**
**save recipe results in local storage**
**quick facts in recipe card**
**fix graph format with %**
**animate.css**
**modals for pop up**
**include header with logo on information page**
**save displayed results in local storage so if user goes back**
