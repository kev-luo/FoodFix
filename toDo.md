**To Do**
**do we create a separate javascript file for each html page?**
**maybe use bulma progress bars instead of chart.js to display nutrition information**
**if we stick with chart.js learn how to add multiple y axes for cleaner display of nutrition**
**fix graph format with %**
**animate.css**
**include header with logo on information page**
**quick facts in recipe card**
