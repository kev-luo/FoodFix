**To Do**
**store searched recipes in local storage so that the user can return to the searched for recipes and choose a different one if they want**
**populate table with ingredients of selected recipe**
**do we create a separate javascript file for each html page?**
**create graph based on recipe nutrients**
**create table based on ingredients list**
**create list? based on recipe instructions**
**do we want to include quick facts alongside recipe title/picture?**
**maybe use bulma progress bars instead of chart.js to display nutrition information**

Done
be able to switch to separate html file when clicking recipe
